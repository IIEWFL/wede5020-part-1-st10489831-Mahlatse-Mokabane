       <section class="content">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in South Africa, Shelter of Kindness emerged as a response to rising challenge of homelessness and family displacement caused by unemployment and financial difficulties. 
            What began as a small effort to provide meals and shelter has grown into a structured program supporting thousands across the region.
        </p>
        <p>The purpose of our organization is to help close the gap between short-term crises and long term recovery. Our goal is to assist people in not just surviving but also rebuilding their lives with stability and hope by providing emergency refuge, necessary resources, counseling, and skill development. </p>

        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Our leadership team is committed to transparency, compassion, and community driven solutions.
            Together with dedicated staff and volunteers we work every day to make our vision a reality.
