<strong>Project Overview</strong>
The non-profit Shelter of Kindness website aims to link communities through volunteerism and donations, provide essential information, and increase awareness of homelessness in South Africa.  The website offers a user-friendly and accessible design along with details on outreach initiatives, fundraising events, and services.  The project, which was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, intends to establish a humane online environment where people may assist those in need and contribute to ending the cycle of homelessness.
